<h2>How to calculate GPA?</h2>

Anna university GPA is calculated as the ratio of the sum of the products of the number of credits of courses registered and the grade points scored in those courses to the sum of the number of credits of in the semester.
<br><br><br>
GPA = ‚àë (ùê∂ùëñ ‚àó ùê∫ùëÉi) / ‚àë ùê∂ùëñ<br><br><br>

 Where,<br><br>

ùê∂ùëñ is the number of credits assigned to the course<br><br>
ùê∫ùëÉi is the grade obtained for each course<br><br>
n is the number of all courses successfully cleared<br><br>
For example, if a semester has 4 subjects with 3 credits each and a student got 9, 8, 8, 9, and 7 in these subjects.<br><br>

So, the GPA = [(9*3 + 8*3 + 8*3 + 9*3 + 7*3)] / 15 = 8.5 GPA .

    Difference between GPA and CGPA
Although both GPA and CGPA indicate the student's academic performance, one big difference exists between them. GPA is the average of the student's grade points in all the courses during a single semester, while CGPA is the average of the grade points obtained by the student during the whole course. GPA is calculated for a single semester, while CGPA is calculated for the entire course duration.

<ul>
<li>The college where the student has studied.</li>
<li>The list of courses enrolled and the grades scored.</li>
<li>The GPA for the semester</li>
<li>The CGPA of all courses enrolled from the first semester onwards.</li>

Where,<br>
<ul>
    <li>Ci is the credit points for a course.</li>
    <li>GPi is the grade point obtained for a course</li>
